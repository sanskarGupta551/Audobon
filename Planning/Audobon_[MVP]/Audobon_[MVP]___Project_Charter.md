Audobon [MVP] envisions a future where comic creation becomes more accessible and efficient through technological innovation. The platform will empower creators by providing professional-grade tools in an intuitive interface, supported by advanced AI models and efficient processing capabilities. This vision encompasses both individual creators working locally and teams collaborating through cloud features.

## Mission Statement

To develop and validate a comprehensive comic generation platform that combines cutting-edge AI technology with practical usability, enabling efficient comic creation through a seamless blend of local and cloud processing capabilities.

## Strategic Objectives

The project aims to achieve several key objectives:

The primary objective is to create a stable, efficient comic generation application that demonstrates the practical implementation of advanced AI models in creative software. This includes developing a robust local processing foundation while incorporating cloud capabilities for enhanced functionality.

Secondary objectives include validating the technical feasibility of assembled AI models, establishing efficient workflows for comic creation, and demonstrating the potential for scalable creative software development.

## Success Criteria

Project success will be measured through several key indicators:

The application must demonstrate stable performance in local processing operations, maintaining responsiveness during complex tasks. Cloud processing capabilities must execute efficiently with reliable task tracking and notification systems. The user interface must provide intuitive access to advanced features while maintaining a clean, uncluttered design.

Technical success metrics include efficient model performance, seamless integration between local and cloud processing, and robust error handling across all features.
