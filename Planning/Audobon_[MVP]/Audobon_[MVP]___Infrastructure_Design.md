- CPU: Minimum 8-core processor with high single-thread performance
- RAM: 32GB minimum, with 64GB recommended for concurrent model operations
- GPU: Dedicated GPU with minimum 8GB VRAM, supporting CUDA for model acceleration
- Storage: NVMe SSD with at least 500GB free space for model storage and processing
- Secondary Storage: Additional SSD/HDD for backup and dataset storage

#### AI Processing Optimization
The local environment implements specific optimizations for AI model operations:
- CUDA toolkit configuration for GPU acceleration
- Memory management optimization for model loading and processing
- Disk I/O optimization for model data access
- Cache configuration for frequent model operations
- Resource monitoring and allocation systems

#### Development Tools Configuration
The development environment includes specialized configurations for AI model development:
- Python environment management with dedicated virtual environments
- Model profiling and debugging tools
- Memory leak detection systems
- Performance monitoring dashboards
- Resource utilization analytics

The development environment incorporates several key components for effective application development. Visual Studio Code serves as the primary IDE, configured with specific extensions for Electron and React development. Docker Desktop enables containerization for consistent development and testing environments. Git provides version control with a configured pre-commit hook system for code quality maintenance.

### Local Build System

The local build system implements a comprehensive workflow for application compilation and testing. Vite manages the development server and build process, providing fast refresh capabilities during development. Electron Builder handles application packaging and distribution, ensuring consistent builds across different platforms. The build system includes automated testing integration, enabling continuous validation during development.

### Testing Infrastructure

The testing infrastructure supports comprehensive application validation through multiple environments. The local testing environment includes Jest for unit testing, Playwright for end-to-end testing, and custom testing utilities for AI model validation. Performance testing tools monitor system resource utilization and processing efficiency. The testing infrastructure maintains separate configurations for development and production testing scenarios.

## Cloud Infrastructure

### Google Cloud Platform Configuration

#### Compute Resources

The cloud infrastructure utilizes several GCP services to support resource-intensive processing tasks. Cloud Run handles serverless compute operations, automatically scaling based on demand. The service configuration ensures optimal resource allocation while maintaining cost efficiency. We implement custom container configurations for specific processing tasks, enabling efficient resource utilization.

#### Storage Architecture

Cloud Storage provides the primary storage solution for cloud-based operations. The storage architecture implements a tiered system, with separate buckets for different data categories. We utilize nearline storage for infrequently accessed data and standard storage for active processing requirements. The storage system implements lifecycle policies for efficient data management and cost optimization.

#### Database Systems

Cloud SQL provides reliable database services for structured data storage. The database implementation includes separate instances for development and production environments. We implement automatic backup procedures and maintain point-in-time recovery capabilities. The database architecture supports efficient data access patterns while ensuring data integrity.

#### Networking Configuration

The networking infrastructure implements secure communication channels between system components. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides isolated network environments for secure operations. Cloud Load Balancing ensures efficient distribution of processing requests. We implement Cloud CDN for optimized content delivery when necessary.

### Task Processing Infrastructure

#### Queue Management

Cloud Tasks manages the processing queue system for background operations. The queue configuration implements priority-based processing with separate queues for different task categories. We maintain monitoring and logging systems for queue performance and task completion status. The queue management system includes automatic retry policies for failed tasks.

#### Background Processing

The background processing system utilizes Cloud Functions for specific processing tasks. Each function implements focused functionality with clear input/output specifications. We maintain separate deployment configurations for development and production environments. The system includes comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities.

### Security Infrastructure

#### Authentication System

Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides the foundation for security control. The authentication system implements role-based access control with specific permission sets for different operation categories. We maintain strict security policies for API access and resource utilization. The system includes audit logging for security-relevant operations.

#### Data Protection

The data protection infrastructure implements comprehensive security measures across all storage and processing systems. Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) manages encryption keys for sensitive data. We implement automatic encryption for data at rest and in transit. The system maintains compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Performance Monitoring

Cloud Monitoring provides comprehensive system monitoring capabilities. The monitoring infrastructure tracks resource utilization, processing performance, and system health metrics. We implement custom dashboards for different monitoring requirements. The system includes automated alerting for performance anomalies.

### Application Logging

Cloud Logging manages centralized log collection and analysis. The logging infrastructure implements structured logging practices with clear categorization of log entries. We maintain separate logging configurations for different environment stages. The system includes log analysis tools for operational insights.

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Systems

The backup infrastructure implements comprehensive data protection measures. We maintain regular backups of all critical system components with automatic scheduling. The backup system includes verification procedures to ensure data integrity. We implement geographic redundancy for critical data storage.

### Recovery Procedures

The disaster recovery system maintains detailed procedures for different failure scenarios. We implement automated recovery processes where possible, with clear manual intervention procedures when necessary. The system includes regular testing of recovery procedures to ensure reliability.

## Cost Management

### Resource Optimization

The infrastructure implements several cost optimization strategies. We utilize committed use discounts where appropriate for predictable workloads. The system includes automatic scaling policies to optimize resource utilization. We maintain regular cost analysis and optimization reviews.

### Usage Monitoring

Cloud Billing provides detailed cost tracking and analysis capabilities. The monitoring system tracks resource usage patterns and associated costs. We implement budget alerts and usage quotas to prevent unexpected expenses. The system includes regular cost reporting and analysis procedures.

## Deployment Infrastructure

### Continuous Integration

Cloud Build manages the continuous integration pipeline. The CI system implements automated build and test procedures for all code changes. We maintain separate build configurations for different deployment targets. The system includes comprehensive validation procedures before deployment.

### Deployment Management

The deployment infrastructure supports controlled rollout of system updates. We implement blue-green deployment strategies for zero-downtime updates. The system includes automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments. We maintain separate deployment procedures for different environment stages.

This infrastructure design provides a robust foundation for Audobon [MVP] while maintaining flexibility for future scaling and enhancement requirements.
