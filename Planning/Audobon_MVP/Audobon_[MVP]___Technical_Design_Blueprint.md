# Audobon [MVP]: Technical Design Blueprint

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Audobon [MVP] system implements a hybrid architecture that combines powerful local processing capabilities with scalable cloud features. The architecture prioritizes performance and reliability while maintaining flexibility for future expansion.

### 1.1 Core Architecture Principles

The system architecture adheres to the following principles:
- Separation of concerns between local and cloud processing
- Modular design for maintainable development
- Asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks
- Clear boundaries between system components
- Robust error handling and recovery

### 1.2 Primary System Components

The system comprises four primary components that work together seamlessly:

The Desktop Application serves as the primary interface and processing hub, handling local computations and user interactions. The Cloud Processing System manages resource-intensive tasks and background processing. The Mobile Companion Application provides task tracking and notifications. The Data Management System coordinates data flow between components.

## 2. Desktop Application Architecture

### 2.1 Application Framework

The desktop application utilizes Electron with React/TypeScript, implementing a clear separation between the main and renderer processes:

The Main Process handles system-level operations, file management, and native APIs. The Renderer Process manages the user interface and light processing tasks. The IPC Bridge facilitates communication between these processes.

### 2.2 Local Processing Engine

The local processing system implements a modular architecture for AI models:

The Model Orchestrator coordinates processing tasks and resource allocation. The Cache Manager optimizes performance through intelligent data caching. The File System Manager handles data persistence and file operations.

### 2.3 UI Architecture

The user interface implements a component-based architecture using React:

The Component Library provides reusable UI elements with consistent styling. The State Management System maintains application state using Redux Toolkit. The Effect System handles side effects and asynchronous operations.

## 3. Cloud Integration Architecture

### 3.1 Cloud Processing System

The cloud infrastructure utilizes GCP services in a scalable architecture:

Cloud Run handles serverless processing tasks with automatic scaling. Cloud Storage manages asset storage and retrieval. Cloud Pub/Sub coordinates messaging and notifications.

### 3.2 Task Management

The task management system implements a reliable processing pipeline:

The Task Scheduler coordinates job execution and resource allocation. The Queue Manager handles task prioritization and scheduling. The Notification System provides status updates and alerts.

## 4. Mobile Companion Architecture

### 4.1 Mobile Application Structure

The mobile application implements a lightweight architecture using React Native:

The Core Module handles essential functionality and state management. The Notification Module manages system alerts and updates. The Communication Module maintains connection with the main application.

## 5. Data Architecture

### 5.1 Data Storage

The system implements a hybrid storage architecture:

Local Storage utilizes SQLite for project data and IndexedDB for assets. Cloud Storage manages shared resources and backups. The Sync Manager coordinates data synchronization.

### 5.2 Data Flow

The data flow architecture ensures efficient information transfer:

The Data Router manages information routing between components. The Transform Layer handles data format conversions. The Validation System ensures data integrity.

## 6. Security Architecture

### 6.1 Security Framework

The security architecture implements comprehensive protection:

The Authentication System manages user identity and access control. The Encryption Module protects sensitive data. The Security Monitor tracks system activity.

## 7. Integration Architecture

### 7.1 System Integration

The integration architecture coordinates component interaction:

The API Gateway manages external communication. The Event Bus coordinates internal messaging. The Integration Manager handles third-party services.

## 8. Performance Architecture

### 8.1 Performance Optimization

The performance architecture ensures efficient operation:

The Resource Manager optimizes system resource utilization. The Performance Monitor tracks system metrics. The Optimization Engine implements performance improvements.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

### 9.1 Deployment Strategy

The deployment architecture ensures reliable software delivery:

The Build System manages application packaging and distribution. The Update Manager handles software updates. The Configuration System manages environment settings.

## 10. Technical Dependencies
