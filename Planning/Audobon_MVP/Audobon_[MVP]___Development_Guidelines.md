# Audobon [MVP]: Development Guidelines

## Introduction

These development guidelines establish the foundational practices and standards for the Audobon [MVP] project. They ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code throughout development while supporting efficient solo development workflows. The guidelines serve as a comprehensive reference for maintaining development quality and consistency across all project phases.

## Code Organization

### Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The main application directory contains distinct sections for core functionality, ensuring logical organization and easy navigation. The source code resides in the 'src' directory, with separate subdirectories for components, services, utilities, and assets.

The components directory maintains a hierarchical structure reflecting the application's UI organization. Each component resides in its own directory containing the component file, associated styles, tests, and documentation. This organization ensures related files remain together while maintaining clear separation between different components.

The services directory contains business logic and data management functionality, organized by domain. Each service maintains clear responsibilities and interfaces, promoting maintainable and testable code. Utility functions reside in a dedicated utilities directory, organized by functionality type.

### File Naming

File names must clearly indicate their purpose and content type. Component files use PascalCase for both the file name and component name (e.g., PanelEditor.tsx). Service and utility files use camelCase and describe their functionality (e.g., imageProcessingService.ts). Test files append '.test' to the name of the file they test (e.g., PanelEditor.test.tsx).

Style files use the same name as their associated component with a '.styles' suffix (e.g., PanelEditor.styles.ts). Documentation files use lowercase with hyphens for separation (e.g., panel-editor-documentation.md). Configuration files use lowercase with dots for separation (e.g., eslint.config.js).

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Usage

The project uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability. All new code must include proper type declarations and interfaces. Type 'any' should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, with explicit type definitions preferred. Generic types should be used where appropriate to maintain code flexibility while ensuring type safety.

Function parameters and return types must be explicitly declared. Interfaces should be used to define complex object structures, with type aliases reserved for simple type definitions. Enums should be used for sets of related constants, maintaining clear naming that reflects their purpose.

### React Patterns

Components should follow functional patterns with hooks for state management and side effects. Each component should maintain a single responsibility, with complex functionality broken down into smaller, focused components. Props must include proper TypeScript interfaces, with required and optional properties clearly indicated.

Custom hooks should be created to encapsulate complex logic or shared functionality. Hook names must start with 'use' and clearly indicate their purpose. Effect hooks should include proper dependency arrays and cleanup functions where necessary. Memoization should be used judiciously to optimize performance when dealing with complex calculations or expensive operations.

### State Management

Redux Toolkit serves as the primary state management solution for application-wide state. State slices should be organized by domain, with clear actions and reducers. Thunks should be used for complex asynchronous operations, maintaining proper error handling and loading states.

Local component state should use useState for simple values and useReducer for complex state logic. Context should be employed for sharing state between related components when Redux would be overkill. State updates must be handled immutably, using proper Redux Toolkit utilities or spread operators.

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

All code must include comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining functionality, parameters, and return values. Complex algorithms or business logic should include detailed explanations of their operation. Comments should focus on explaining why certain decisions were made rather than what the code does when the code is self-documenting.

Documentation must remain up to date with code changes, with outdated comments treated as bugs. API documentation should include example usage and potential error conditions. Type definitions should include clear descriptions of their purpose and constraints.

### Technical Documentation

System-level documentation must be maintained in Markdown format, stored alongside the code. Architecture decisions should be documented with clear rationales and considerations. Integration points between components should include detailed documentation of their interfaces and expected behaviors.

Setup and configuration procedures must be documented clearly, including all necessary steps and potential issues. Performance considerations and optimization strategies should be documented for complex operations.

## Version Control Practices

### Git Workflow

The project follows a structured Git workflow even in solo development. Each feature or fix should be developed in a dedicated branch, with clear, descriptive branch names. Commit messages must follow conventional commit format, clearly describing the changes and their purpose.

Regular commits should be made to track progress and enable effective rollback if needed. Commits should represent logical units of work, maintaining clear separation between different changes. Branch management should include regular cleanup of merged branches.

### Code Reviews

Self-review procedures should be implemented before merging any changes. A systematic review checklist should be followed, covering code quality, testing, documentation, and performance considerations. Review comments should be documented for future reference and learning.

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

All new code must include appropriate test coverage, with a minimum threshold of 80% for critical components. Unit tests should verify individual component and function behavior. Integration tests must validate interactions between components and services.

Test files should be organized alongside the code they test, maintaining clear naming relationships. Test descriptions should clearly indicate the functionality being tested and expected outcomes. Edge cases and error conditions must be included in test coverage.

### Test Implementation

Tests should follow arrange-act-assert pattern for clarity. Mock data and services should be used to isolate components during testing. Test utilities should be created for common testing patterns and shared test data.

## Performance Guidelines

### Optimization Practices

Performance optimization should be considered during initial development rather than as an afterthought. Resource-intensive operations should include appropriate loading states and progress indicators. Lazy loading should be implemented for components and resources not needed for initial render.

Image optimization must be implemented for all visual assets. Caching strategies should be employed for frequently accessed data and computation results. Memory management should be carefully considered, with proper cleanup of resources and event listeners.

## Security Practices

### Data Protection

All sensitive data must be properly encrypted during storage and transmission. API keys and credentials should never be committed to version control. Input validation must be implemented for all user inputs and file operations.

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling must be implemented throughout the application. Error boundaries should be used to prevent component tree crashes. User-facing error messages should be clear and helpful while avoiding technical details.

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

The development environment must be properly configured with all necessary tools and extensions. Local development should utilize the development server with hot reloading enabled. Regular testing should be performed in the local environment before any deployments.

### Build Process

Build configurations should be maintained for different deployment targets. Build optimization should be implemented for production releases. Asset optimization should be included in the build process.

These guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for maintaining high-quality development practices throughout the project lifecycle while remaining practical for solo development implementation.
